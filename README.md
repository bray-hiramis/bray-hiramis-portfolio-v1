# Mini Portfolio Website

Welcome to my Mini Portfolio Project!
This project is part of my ongoing journey in mastering HTML and CSS as I work through my web development curriculum at freeCodeCamp.

## 🌟 Project Overview
This mini portfolio is a simple, desktop-first layout that highlights:

- A clean Header with my name and navigation links
- A Hero Section introducing myself with text and a profile image
- An About Me Section to share a little bit more about my story
- A Skills Section listing my core abilities
- A Projects Section showcasing sample works
- A Contact Section for getting in touch
- A simple Footer for copyright and attribution

## 🎯 What I Practiced

- Structuring a webpage using semantic HTML
- Styling layouts using external CSS
- Responsive design principles (Desktop-first approach)
- Typography basics and color contrast
- Building good accessibility foundations
