# Mini Portfolio Website

## Project Description

This is a simple, single-page personal portfolio website built as a learning project. The primary goal was to reinforce fundamental HTML and CSS concepts, with a strong focus on implementing **Responsive Design** using **CSS Flexbox** and **Media Queries**.

The website serves as a digital "About Me" page, showcasing:
- A brief introduction.
- Key web development skills being learned.
- Links to past projects.
- A basic contact form.

It's designed to adapt its layout and appearance to provide an optimal viewing experience across a range of devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the basic structure and content.
* **CSS3:** For all styling and layout.
    * **Flexbox:** Used for creating one-dimensional layouts (like the header, hero section, skills section, and project row on desktop).
    * **CSS Media Queries:** Implemented to apply different styles and change the layout based on viewport width (responsive design).
* **Normalize.css:** Included to provide consistent cross-browser rendering.
* **Font Awesome:** Used for icons (e.g., GitHub icon).
* **Google Fonts:** Used for custom typography (Inter and Montserrat).

## Features

* Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
* Sticky header navigation for easy access to sections while scrolling.
* Smooth scrolling navigation between sections.
* Clear sections for About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact.
